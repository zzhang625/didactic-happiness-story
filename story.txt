Bernadette is exhaused after school works. She is a college student at University of Wisconsin-Madison. After her computer science class, she meets her high school classmate Calvin. Calvin is not working hard and is not getting a good grade. His grade is so bad that he is about to be kicked out of college. "Is there anything you can help me with?" He asked.

All I can say about that is to study hard!!!!
